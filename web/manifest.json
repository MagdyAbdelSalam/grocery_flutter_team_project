After authentication, the user is redirected to the Home Screen, which contains a Bottom Navigation Bar with Home, Favorites, and Portfolio tabs. A Floating Action Button leads to the Order Success screen.  Other screens include Categories, Produce, and Produce Details. The project uses Named Routes for navigation, a feature-based folder structure, and GitHub for version control. Each team member is responsible for two screens.",
