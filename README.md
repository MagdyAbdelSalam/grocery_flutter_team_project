# grocery_app

Project Description  This Flutter project is a grocery/produce application developed as a team project.  The app starts with Splash screens, followed by Login and Sign Up. After authentication, the user is redirected to the Home Screen, which contains a Bottom Navigation Bar with Home, Favorites, and Portfolio tabs. A Floating Action Button leads to the Order Success screen.  Other screens include Categories, Produce, and Produce Details. The project uses Named Routes for navigation, a feature-based folder structure, and GitHub for version control. Each team member is responsible for two screens.
